## Overview

Oxid is a desktop application that brings AI-powered coding assistance to your local development environment. Unlike cloud-based solutions, Oxid runs entirely on your machine, ensuring your code and API keys stay private.

### Key Features

- üñ•Ô∏è **Desktop-First**: Native desktop app built with Tauri for optimal performance
- üîê **Privacy-Focused**: All processing happens locally, your code never leaves your machine
- üéØ **Free & Open Source**: No subscription fees, bring your own API keys
- üöÄ **Fast & Lightweight**: Built with Rust and React for speed and efficiency
- üîß **Extensible**: Modular architecture designed for customization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Rust (latest stable version)
- Platform-specific dependencies:
  - **Windows**: Microsoft C++ Build Tools
  - **macOS**: Xcode Command Line Tools
  - **Linux**: See [Tauri prerequisites](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/oxid-dev/oxid.app.git
cd oxid.app
