## Overview

Oxid is a desktop application that brings AI-powered coding assistance to your local development environment. Unlike cloud-based solutions, Oxid runs entirely on your machine, ensuring your code and API keys stay private.

### Key Features

- 🖥️ **Desktop-First**: Native desktop app built with Tauri for optimal performance
- 🔐 **Privacy-Focused**: All processing happens locally, your code never leaves your machine
- 🎯 **Free & Open Source**: No subscription fees, bring your own API keys
- 🚀 **Fast & Lightweight**: Built with Rust and React for speed and efficiency
- 🔧 **Extensible**: Modular architecture designed for customization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Rust (latest stable version)
- Platform-specific dependencies:
  - **Windows**: Microsoft C++ Build Tools
  - **macOS**: Xcode Command Line Tools
  - **Linux**: See [Tauri prerequisites](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/oxid-dev/oxid.app.git
cd oxid.app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run in development mode:
```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

### Building

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

The built application will be in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start Vite development server
- `npm run tauri dev` - Start Tauri in development mode
- `npm run build` - Build web assets
- `npm run tauri build` - Build desktop application
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Desktop**: Tauri v2 (Rust)
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Code Editor**: Monaco Editor (planned)
- **AI Integration**: Claude Code SDK (MVP), custom agent system (future)

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed (MVP Phase 1)
- [x] Project setup with Tauri v2 + React 18 + TypeScript
- [x] Complete folder structure following atomic design principles
- [x] UI component library (atoms, molecules) with dark theme
- [x] Working chat interface with mock AI responses
- [x] State management with Zustand
- [x] Routing with React Router (hash routing for desktop)
- [x] Development tooling (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript)
- [x] Production build pipeline

### 🚧 Next Phase (AI Integration)
- [ ] Replace mock AI with Claude Code SDK
- [ ] File system operations via Tauri
- [ ] Project management (open/save/create)
- [ ] Settings page with API key management
- [ ] Error handling and user feedback

### 🔮 Future Phases
- [ ] Monaco Editor integration for code editing
- [ ] Custom agent system architecture
- [ ] Multi-LLM support (user's own API keys)
- [ ] Local indexing and RAG capabilities
- [ ] Plugin system for extensibility
